# TSS-Growth-Chamber
A True Shallot Seed (TSS) Growth Chamber is a prototype designed to control temperature and relative humidity to maintain optimal conditions for the development of true shallot seed technology during the flowering phase of shallots. This TSS Growth Chamber initially started as an internship project established by BRIN (The National Research and Innovation Agency of The Republic of Indonesia), and has since undergone further development to significantly enhance shallot production in lowland regions that experience relatively high temperatures.
